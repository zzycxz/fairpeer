// maxWriteBytes caps the content length a writer tool will accept. Without it a
// model can paste an oversized payload (e.g. a directory dump or a repetition
// loop) into write_file/edit_file/apply_patch and produce a huge single file
// that bloats checkpoint snapshots, slows grep, or fills the disk. 5 MiB is
// well above any realistic source file while catching pathological output; a
// genuinely large artifact (data, logs, minified bundles) should go through
// bash redirection rather than a model-generated tool argument.
//
// Enforced by writeFileEncoded (write_file/edit_file/multi_edit/apply_patch/
// delete_range) AND by doc_write's own check (document.go:698, which bypasses
// writeFileEncoded because its atomic-write path is separate). Both checks are
// deliberate — removing the doc_write one would re-open the cap gap.

// editing/appending a multi-GB file (e.g. a log) would os.ReadFile the whole
// thing and OOM the process. 10 MiB covers any realistic source/config/text
// file the model should edit in place; larger artifacts should be handled via
// bash (head/tail/sed) or the document tools' streaming path. This bounds only
// the read; the write is separately capped by maxWriteBytes.
